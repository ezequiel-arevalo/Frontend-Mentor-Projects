## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts
- PX to REM conversor

### What I Learned

Throughout this project, I expanded my knowledge in several areas:

- **BEM Methodology in CSS:** I learned how to organize and structure my CSS using the BEM methodology, which improves code maintainability and scalability.
- **Using REM Units instead of PX:** I switched to REM units for a more flexible and accessible design compared to fixed PX values.
- **Optimizing Font Imports:** I optimized font loading using *Font Display Swap*, which enhances user experience by preventing content blocking during font loading.
- **Reducing CSS Code:** I leveraged default properties to simplify and reduce my CSS code, resulting in a cleaner and more efficient stylesheet.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to further deepen my skills in:

- Applying CSS organization methodologies like BEM.
- Adopting modern practices for resource optimization, such as using REM units and optimizing font imports.
- Exploring new techniques for performance and accessibility improvements in web development.
